I have hosted phone banks using NGPVAN and find it to be very stable and we will continue to phone bank next January, after the holidays. A recent letter to supporters in Albuquerque....Hi all\n\nDavid in Taos here. True, being ignored and marginalized is something we all have dealt with if we have ever been in politics, and  especially working for an underdog. I am already worried this inspirational letter will be ignored because it is not from someone you know, or who lives in Albuquerque, but here goes. In 2010, I joined a campaign against Speaker Ben Lujan by Carl Trujillo. He was labeled a nobody, had a third of the budget (30,000$), was denied a debate and access to Votebuilder. Sound familiar? We created work-arounds, gained access to voter rolls via another campaign and lost by 80 votes. In fact, he would have won if it was revealed that Ben Lujan was already diagnosed with cancer. He was young, ran against the then Mayor of Santa Fe, David Coss (who wanted to hold both seats) the next election cycle and handily won. He is now a State Representative.\n\nBernie Sanders does not have four more years to run. This is our only shot, so we have to work very hard. Bernie\'s campaign is well organized and has a platform that is not radical whatsoever when compared with most first world nations. I can\'t help but notice similarities to the Podemos movement in Spain, who swept into seats in Madrid, Barcelona and all over the country this summer. They too were underdogs, ignored by the media, told they were too radical.\n\nIn a short video I made while visiting this summer a woman explains in Spanish how a well advertised rally during Fiesta de San Isidro at a prominent location was moved last minute by those in power. Why? Voter and campaign suppression. They were regulated to a park a few blocks away, with no stage. Yet so enthusiastic to win, within hours they arranged for a sound system and staging to be brought in. This woman was posted at the original location, directing people to the park down the hill where thousands attended. It was an inspiration to witness, first hand, the underdogs win later that week in Madrid. In fact, they actually got second place, but with multiple parties, other candidates can give their votes away, and so they went from second to first, with the help of the socialist party. A woman explains the rest in English. They won! https://vimeo.com/127766033\n\nLater in Barcelona I stumbled upon a presentation by radical activists about how their housing struggle (Albuquerque was recently named the worst place to own a home) elected the first female Mayor of Barcelona. The movements in Spain would be as if our own social movements were to create new parties and elect new politicians. We cannot here because corporations own both parties, we cannot afford it, and the country is immense. Bernie is our last chance to galvanize people and fight for what we all know is right. The alternative? The morally bankrupt Clintons, or worse, a proto fascist like Trump, but you already knew that. https://vimeo.com/131662060\n\nI am available to support anyone who needs media or the advice of a political operative that has been in tight races small and medium sized, and even Obama as a field organizer in Farmington and Santa Fe in 08. We need to work together. My thoughts on our issues are articulated in a letter to Arturo Carmona, southwest political director and Latino outreach director pasted below and my resume attached. Thanks for your time and letting me blow my own horn.
